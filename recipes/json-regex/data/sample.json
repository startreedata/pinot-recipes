When clicking the button to clear the image, the popover is closed. We confirmed that the popover is closed by the `useOutsideClick` hook. We suspect this happens because the clear button is removed from the DOM before the outside click handler is executed, so it doesn't know that the clear button was _inside_ the popover. In order to prevent this, we plan to use `event.stopPropagation()` in the `onClear` callback.\r\n\r\nThe second challenge we faced was using the ImageInput with the `identity` variant of the Avatar component which has a circular border radius. \r\n\r\n## Approach and changes\r\n\r\n- Pass the click event to the `onClear` prop of the ImageInput\r\n- Make the ImageInput's border-radius configurable through the addition of a `borderRadius` prop (I‚Äôm not happy about exposing such a verbose styling prop, but I don‚Äôt see a better way üòï)\r\n\r\n## Definition of done\r\n\r\n* [x]

When clicking the button to clear the image, the popover is closed. We confirmed that the popover is closed by the `useOutsideClick` hook. We suspect this happens because the clear button is removed from the DOM before the outside click handler is executed, so it doesn't know that the clear button was _inside_ the popover. In order to prevent this, we plan to use `event.stopPropagation()` in the `onClear` callback.\r\n\r\nThe second challenge we faced was using the ImageInput with the `identity` variant of the Avatar component which has a circular border radius. \r\n\r\n## Approach and changes\r\n\r\n- Pass the click event to the `onClear` prop of the ImageInput\r\n- Make the ImageInput's border-radius configurable through the addition of a `borderRadius` prop (I‚Äôm not happy about exposing such a verbose styling prop, but I don‚Äôt see a better way üòï)\r\n\r\n## Definition of done\r\n\r\n* [x] Development completed\r\n* [x] Reviewers assigned\r\n* [x] Unit and integration tests\r\n* [x] Meets minimum browser support\r\n* [x] Meets accessibility

close #26251\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and how it works?\r\n\r\nWhat's Changed:\r\n\r\nIn `SelectLock` executor, `tblID2PIDColumnIndex`   map the table ID to partition ID column, the partition ID is obtained by\r\n\r\n```\r\noffset := e.tblID2PIDColumnIndex[id]\r\nphysicalID = row.GetInt64(offset)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases like #26251, the table is not a partition table, so it's not in `tblID2PIDColumnIndex`\r\nThe original table ID should be used, instead of try to mapping it to partition ID.\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\n\r\n### Check List <!--REMOVE the items that are not applicable-->\r\n\r\nTests <!-- At least one of them must be included. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Unit test\r\n- [ ] Integration test\r\n- [ ] Manual test (add detailed scripts or steps below)\r\n- [ ]

close #26251\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and how it works?\r\n\r\nWhat's Changed:\r\n\r\nIn `SelectLock` executor, `tblID2PIDColumnIndex`   map the table ID to partition ID column, the partition ID is obtained by\r\n\r\n```\r\noffset := e.tblID2PIDColumnIndex[id]\r\nphysicalID = row.GetInt64(offset)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases like #26251, the table is not a partition table, so it's not in `tblID2PIDColumnIndex`\r\nThe original table ID should be used, instead of try to mapping it to partition ID.\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\n\r\n### Check List <!--REMOVE the items that are not applicable-->\r\n\r\nTests <!-- At least one of them must be included. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Unit test\r\n- [ ] Integration test\r\n- [ ] Manual test (add detailed scripts or steps below)\r\n- [ ]

Not sure I see the value - LC_ID = 'lower case id', UC_ID = 'upper case id'; 'UNDERSCORE_ID' = underscore id. If we want nicer names I'd rather do that in the major revamp I am working on.\r\n\r\nI interpreted the rule names as: \"ALPHA_UC_ID\": ID starting with an ALPHA_UC (upper case letter), \"ALPHA_LC_ID\": ID starting with an ALPHA_LC (lower case letter).\r\n\r\nThen \"ALPHA_UNDERSCORE_ID\" would be ID starting with an ALPHA_UNDERSCORE, but that is strange.

Currently, only CPU tests were\nimplemented. That's because neither PyTorch nor Numba implements CPython's buffer\nprotocol. Therefore, there's no way to create a CUDA buffer with the existing\ndependencies (could use PyCUDA for that, though).\n\nAt the moment, if `device` differs from the device the buffer actually lives, two things\nmay happen:\n\n- `RuntimeError`, if `device='cuda'`\n- Segmentation fault (not tested -- see above), if `device='cpu'`\n\n[ghstack-poisoned]","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/commits/311de418072245d3f8864e3b9b065c3ba92914b9"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T09:00:15Z","org":{"id":21003710,"login":"pytorch","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pytorch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21003710?"}}

There are mostly configs in that namespace, but also important `shredding_complete` which is used in the RDB Loader\r\n* But then realised we have [`com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch`](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/tree/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch) and RDB Loader already [produces](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/ad7e781e3eccf6e0bc29180fd96c066f85b8e6dc/modules/loader/src/main/scala/com/snowplowanalytics/snowplow/rdbloader/dsl/Monitoring.scala#L52-L53) events with those schemas, just as Snowplow events (that we're not using for a long time), not as webhook payloads. I also think it makes sense to call it \"batch\" because RDB Loader is essentially a batch loader. The only problem with that namespace is that beside of this new schema it's mostly dead and unused\r\n* Another option on name would be `loader_alert` - I don't think we plan to issue it from any other apps\r\n\r\nOn properties:\r\n\r\n* `folder` is optional because not always a folder results in alert\r\n\r\nExample payload:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"schema\": \"iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch/alert/jsonschema/1-0-0\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"folder\": \"s3://acme-snowplow/shredded/v1/run=2021-07-19-23-30-00\",\r\n    \"version\":

There are mostly configs in that namespace, but also important `shredding_complete` which is used in the RDB Loader\r\n* But then realised we have [`com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch`](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/tree/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch) and RDB Loader already [produces](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-rdb-loader/blob/ad7e781e3eccf6e0bc29180fd96c066f85b8e6dc/modules/loader/src/main/scala/com/snowplowanalytics/snowplow/rdbloader/dsl/Monitoring.scala#L52-L53) events with those schemas, just as Snowplow events (that we're not using for a long time), not as webhook payloads. I also think it makes sense to call it \"batch\" because RDB Loader is essentially a batch loader. The only problem with that namespace is that beside of this new schema it's mostly dead and unused\r\n* Another option on name would be `loader_alert` - I don't think we plan to issue it from any other apps\r\n\r\nOn properties:\r\n\r\n* `folder` is optional because not always a folder results in alert\r\n\r\nExample payload:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"schema\": \"iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.monitoring.batch/alert/jsonschema/1-0-0\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"folder\": \"s3://acme-snowplow/shredded/v1/run=2021-07-19-23-30-00\",\r\n    \"version\":

// Returns JsonError by default.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I implement `JsonNullValue#setErrorNotForClientCall` method which returns `JsonNullValue`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// In JsonNullValue class\r\npublic setErrorNotForClientCall(s: string): Value {\r\n  this._stringBuffer = s;\r\n  return JsonError.nullValue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the cause of the second issue is `JsonError#getVector` returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `JsonError#getVector` is in `Value#getVector`, so I change it to return empty csmVector values.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- public getVector(defaultValue?: csmVector<Value>): csmVector<Value> {\r\n+ public getVector(defaultValue = new csmVector<Value>()): csmVector<Value> {\r\n    return defaultValue;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `JsonError#getVector#getSize` returns `0` value.\r\n\r\nFinally all test case passed!\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Test result</summary>\r\n\r\n```log\r\n PASS  ./index.test.js\r\n  ‚úì Validate \"isExistMotionCurveFadeInTime\" (2 ms)\r\n  ‚úì Validate \"isExistMotionCurveFadeOutTime\" (1 ms)\r\n  ‚úì Validate \"getMotionCurveSegmentCount\"\r\n\r\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\r\nTests:       3 passed, 3 total\r\nSnapshots:   0 total\r\nTime:        0.284 s, estimated 1 s\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI think there are other issues in `CubismJson` class, but I fixed these issues first of all.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Live2D/CubismWebFramework/issues/comments/884018882","html_url":"https://github.com/Live2D/CubismWebFramework/pull/9#issuecomment-884018882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Live2D/CubismWebFramework/issues/9","id":884018882,"node_id":"IC_kwDODbQ-Is40sQ7C","user":{"login":"wada-at-live2d-com","id":45452236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDUyMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45452236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com","html_url":"https://github.com/wada-at-live2d-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wada-at-live2d-com/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T09:00:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T09:00:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cocor-au-lait\r\nThank you for pull request and investigation!\r\nSorry for the late reply.\r\n\r\nThanks for the fix! \r\n`Cannot read property 'setErrorNotForClientCall' of undefined` is indeed an unintended behavior.\r\nWe're currently investigating the behavior of Curves and CurveCount and will merge this PR soon.\r\nPlease wait a little longer.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T09:00:16Z","org":{"id":747185,"login":"Live2D","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/Live2D","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/747185?"}}

Currently, only CPU tests were\nimplemented. That's because neither PyTorch nor Numba implements CPython's buffer\nprotocol. Therefore, there's no way to create a CUDA buffer with the existing\ndependencies (could use PyCUDA for that, though).\n\nAt the moment, if `device` differs from the device the buffer actually lives, two things\nmay happen:\n\n- `RuntimeError`, if `device='cuda'`\n- Segmentation fault (not tested -- see above), if `device='cpu'`\n\nFixed failing CI tests.\n\nghstack-source-id: 7290850d4c28d6cc39c8ad8a9eea908d6323a43c\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/59077","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/commits/8c404e66bf6dea85e965b4b18be85c3ab7e17c35"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T09:00:17Z","org":{"id":21003710,"login":"pytorch","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pytorch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21003710?"}}

This PR fixes or fixes part of NA.\r\n2. This PR does the following: \r\n- Adds type annotations to non-test files of:\r\n  - core/platform/datastore\r\n  - core/platform/transaction\r\n  - core/platform/models\r\n  - core/storage/activity\r\n  - core/storage/app_feedback_report\r\n  - core/storage/audit\r\n  - core/storage/auth\r\n  - core/storage/base_model\r\n- Adds mypy_imports file:\r\n  -  MyPy doesn't work well with passing of modules as variables. This is what we do when we import modules from `core/storage` and `core/platform`. Example: `datastore_services`, `base_models`, `auth_models`. \r\n  - That's why we have added the following code snippet so that MyPy can detect the modules we are importing in a file.\r\n    ```\r\n    MYPY = False\r\n    if MYPY:\r\n        from mypy_imports import * # pragma: no cover # pylint: disable=import-only-modules,wildcard-import,unused-wildcard-import\r\n     ```\r\n  - The part inside the if block only runs when we run type checks. While running type checks, mypy will override the value of variable `MYPY` to `True`. This is substitute of [typing.TYPE_CHECKING ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING)in py2.\r\n- Some type ignores in other files(Ex: main.py)  were removed as they were fixed after I added type annotations to some files.\r\n- We create enums in a very dynamic way using the function `create_enum`. Therefore mypy is unable to understand the type of our enums. Therefore we have to annotate our enums as type `Any`.\r\n- I added `__init__` in models where they are not present for mypy to work correctly. If the constructor is not added, MyPy assumes the subclass variable's type to be that of Parent class.\r\n- I have used self typing in core/storage/base_models. Self typing is giving the type of `cls` or `self` variables so that their type information can be used in type annotations. This is because we subclass the classes of base_models and we need to work them properly. For example: get_version of VersionedModel returns the instance which is either VersionedModel or its subclass. So explicitly mentioning VersionModel there will instruct MyPy that the return type is VersionedModel(not its subclass).\r\n\r\n## Essential Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with \"Fix #bugnum: \", followed by a short, clear summary of the changes.

This PR fixes or fixes part of NA.\r\n2. This PR does the following: \r\n- Adds type annotations to non-test files of:\r\n  - core/platform/datastore\r\n  - core/platform/transaction\r\n  - core/platform/models\r\n  - core/storage/activity\r\n  - core/storage/app_feedback_report\r\n  - core/storage/audit\r\n  - core/storage/auth\r\n  - core/storage/base_model\r\n- Adds mypy_imports file:\r\n  -  MyPy doesn't work well with passing of modules as variables. This is what we do when we import modules from `core/storage` and `core/platform`. Example: `datastore_services`, `base_models`, `auth_models`. \r\n  - That's why we have added the following code snippet so that MyPy can detect the modules we are importing in a file.\r\n    ```\r\n    MYPY = False\r\n    if MYPY:\r\n        from mypy_imports import * # pragma: no cover # pylint: disable=import-only-modules,wildcard-import,unused-wildcard-import\r\n     ```\r\n  - The part inside the if block only runs when we run type checks. While running type checks, mypy will override the value of variable `MYPY` to `True`. This is substitute of [typing.TYPE_CHECKING ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING)in py2.\r\n- Some type ignores in other files(Ex: main.py)  were removed as they were fixed after I added type annotations to some files.\r\n- We create enums in a very dynamic way using the function `create_enum`. Therefore mypy is unable to understand the type of our enums. Therefore we have to annotate our enums as type `Any`.\r\n- I added `__init__` in models where they are not present for mypy to work correctly. If the constructor is not added, MyPy assumes the subclass variable's type to be that of Parent class.\r\n- I have used self typing in core/storage/base_models. Self typing is giving the type of `cls` or `self` variables so that their type information can be used in type annotations. This is because we subclass the classes of base_models and we need to work them properly. For example: get_version of VersionedModel returns the instance which is either VersionedModel or its subclass. So explicitly mentioning VersionModel there will instruct MyPy that the return type is VersionedModel(not its subclass).\r\n\r\n## Essential Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with \"Fix #bugnum: \", followed by a short, clear summary of the changes.

Your work is exactly what I am looking for. Recently I am trying to reconstruct a scene using your code. Following the step-by-step instructions in the [README ](https://github.com/palanglois/line-surface-reconstruction/tree/master/full_examples/from_raw_images)file, I could not get a good result even though I have adjusted the parameters several times. \r\n\r\n- the output result of Line3D++ is good\r\n- run colmapToRANSACInput.py, and I got  the line3dpp_output.json file\r\n- run ransac_on_lines, and I got test_input_for_reconstruction.json and  test_no_refine_input_for_reconstruction.json\r\n- using the  OpenGL viewer you provide, I found the results above is okay!\r\n\r\n- run colmapRansacOutToResidualReconsInput.py, and I get the input_lines_from_residuals.json file. **The result is bad.** the lengths of some lines are much longer than they should be.\r\n\r\n- and then I run the  command\r\n`$LINE_RECONS/build/line_based_recons_param -i input_lines_from_residuals.json -o data/  -ext -v`\r\n\r\nI get a result. But the result is barely recognizable. I could not find the correspondence between the reconstruction result and the original scene. I think the problem lies in the colmapRansacOutToResidualReconsInput.py step. \r\n\r\n- then I tried using the result **test_input_for_reconstruction.json** instead of the **input_lines_from_residuals.json** to do the reconstruction by running:\r\n\r\n`line_based_recons_param -i test_input_for_reconstruction.json -o data/ -np 120 -ext -v`\r\n\r\nand I get a better result.\r\n\r\nSo I want to know more about the python file(**colmapRansacOutToResidualReconsInput.py** and **colmapToRANSACInput.py**) in detail cause I don't know what  the python file is used to do exactly.

As you can see, the pillar is intersected by the visibility triangle, which may prevent it from being reconstructed (our visibility term encourages emptiness in the visibility triangle).\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this issue, I created the **colmapRansacOutToResidualReconsInput.py** script in order to project the residuals on the 3D line segments and thus split the 3D line for each residual that generated it.\r\n\r\nFor the top camera, this leads to using the following visibility triangle (in yellow):\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palanglois/line-surface-reconstruction/master/data/images/Visibility_residuals.png)\r\n\r\nI have always had better results doing things that way so far. However, here is my hypothesis regarding what occurs on your scene: the above method generates one 3D line segments per residual. While this addresses the occlusion issue, this may also lead to making the linear program more complicated (maybe some information is used several times when 2 residual projections overlap ?).\r\n\r\nYour input would actually be valuable.
